│  1.2) HDTV sources must not be upscaled, see section 3.                     │
│  1.3) Providers which downscale 1080i to 720p (e.g. BellTV) are not         │
│       allowed.                                                              │

│  2.1) Analogue HDTV is considered as a high definition captured stream from │
│       the analog output (e.g. Component, DVI, HDMI) of a set-top box.       │
│  2.2) Captures must be done at the native broadcast format of the source.   │

│          must be restored to the original framerate.                        │
│   2.2.2) If captures cannot be completely restored to their native          │
│          framerate, such as a single dupe frame every 1000 or blended/ghost │
│          frames due to mangling from the set-top box or capture device,     │
│          this is considered a technical flaw.                               │

│  3.1) High-Resolution PDTV is considered as non-high definition content     │
│       which has been upscaled and broadcasted on a high definition channel. │
│   3.1.1) Windowboxed content (large black bars on all sides) lack           │
│          sufficient source resolution to be considered HR.PDTV, and is not  │

│   4.1.1) Custom builds of x264 (e.g. x264-tMod, x264-kMod) are allowed and  │
│          must be based off the x264 codebase.                               │
│  4.2) x264 headers must remain intact and must not be modified or removed.  │

│       period, of 60 days before groups are required to update to the latest │
│       revision.                                                             │
│   4.3.1) The official x264 git repository is the only reference for         │
│          determining the current revision:                                  │

│          tagged encoded date.                                               │

│                2016-03-02: Revision A is no longer allowed, Revision B or   │
│                C may be used.                                               │
│                2016-03-05: Revision B is no longer allowed, Revision C      │
│                must be used.                                                │
│  4.4) Constant Rate Factor (--crf) must be used.                            │
│   4.4.1) CRF values below 18 and above 23 are never allowed.                │
│   4.4.2) Justification must be listed in the NFO for the use of             │
│          non-standard CRF values.                                           │
│    4.4.2.1) Groups are not required to follow non-standard CRF values used  │
│             by another group.                                               │
│    4.4.2.2) It is suggested that if the average video bitrate exceeds       │
│             5000kb/s, a higher CRF value should be chosen, when possible.   │
│  4.5) Standard CRF values are as follows:                                   │

│   4.12.1) It is recommended to let x264 decide which value to use, but      │
│           10*framerate is a good guideline (e.g. Film=240, PAL=250,         │

│  5.5) English spoken titles with foreign overlays, not intended by content  │
│       creators (e.g. locations, on-screen text shown in another language)   │

│          for English spoken scenes are not allowed, use INTERNAL.           │
│   5.6.3) Hardcoded subtitles added by content creators are exempt (e.g.     │
│          Alien hardsubs, drunk talk hardsubs, hardsubs due to muffled mic). │
│  5.7) Dupes based on resolution are not allowed.                            │

│   5.7.2) Releases which contain at least an additional 20 pixels worth of   │
│          video on any side are not considered dupes. These releases must be │
│          tagged as WS or OM (open matte) and not proper, and the original   │
│          release must not be nuked.                                         │
│  5.8) Black borders and anything (e.g. coloured borders, duplicate lines,   │
│       dirty pixels, full-time tickers) that is not part of the video must   │
│       be cropped.                                                           │
│   5.8.1) Retention or removal of faded edges is left to the discretion of   │
│          the group. Inclusion of faded edges is not a technical flaw, and   │
│          cannot be propered.                                                │
│    5.8.1.1) Faded edges refer to a line of pixels which are of similar      │
│             appearance to pixels' parallel to the video frame.              │
│   5.8.2) In the case of varying aspect ratios throughout the video,         │
│          cropping must be done to the most common frame size (e.g.          │
│          primary view of the pitch during sports, studio view during        │
│          talk shows).                                                       │
│   5.8.3) Cropping of letterboxed sources with hardcoded subtitles           │
│          positioned within the black borders is left to the discretion      │
│          of the group. Video may be left uncropped or cropped evenly        │
│          both top and bottom to the widest frame without removing any       │
│          subtitles.                                                         │
│    5.8.3.1) Cropping out hardcoded subtitles entirely is allowed, only when │
│             they are not required, leaving any trace of subtitles or        │
│             over-cropping actual picture to remove subtitles is considered  │
│             to be a technical flaw.                                         │
│   5.8.4) Video may be over or under cropped by a maximum of 1px per side.   │
│          Over or under cropping by more than 1px per side is considered a   │

│          true 50 / 60 FPS, is considered a technical flaw.                  │
│   7.2.2) In cases of varying framerates of 25 / 30 FPS and true 50 / 60     │
│          FPS, the framerate of the main feature must be used (e.g. studio   │

│       sources) and may or may not require IVTC is left to the discretion    │
│       of the group. The NFO must list a reason as to the final decision.    │
│   7.3.1) It is assumed that the majority of a title contains enough unique  │
│          frames at 30,000/1,001 FPS to warrant a higher framerate. If it    │
│          can be proven IVTC/decimating does not result in any loss of       │
│          unique frames, this is considered a technical flaw.                │
│  7.4) Native and converted framerates refers to the standard in which the   │
│       video was produced.                                                   │

│  7.5) Converted video that has significant abnormalities (e.g. blended      │
│       frames, jerky playback due to missing or duplicate frames) due to     │

│  8.2) Multiple language audio tracks are allowed.                           │
│   8.2.1) The default audio track must be the language intended for release  │
│          (e.g. An English release containing English, German and Russian    │
│          audio tracks, must have the default flag set on the English        │
│          track).                                                            │
│   8.2.2) The correct ISO 639 language code supported by MKVToolnix must be  │
│          set for all secondary audio tracks, default may be left undefined. │
│    8.2.2.1) In situations where the language is not supported by            │
│             MKVToolnix, 'und' must be used.                                 │
│  8.3) If the original language of a title is not English:                   │

│  9.1) Where audio or video issues are unavoidable due to a live-broadcast   │
│       or mastering issues, a release must not be nuked until a valid        │
│       proper, repack or rerip which does not exhibit the same flaw is       │
│       released.                                                             │
│  9.2) Scrolling or other alert messages added by the broadcasting station   │
│       (e.g. Weather or Amber alerts) appearing for a cumulative total of    │
│       at least 30 seconds throughout the entire release is considered a     │
│       technical flaw.                                                       │
│  9.3) Video frame abnormalities (e.g. Abnormal snipes/pop-ups, banner       │
│       advertisements that do not fade out entirely) as a result of broken   │
│       splicing originating from the broadcasting station is considered a    │
│       technical flaw.                                                       │
│  9.4) Missing or repeated video footage without any loss of dialogue must   │
│       be at least 2 seconds long at any one instance to be considered a     │
│       technical flaw.                                                       │
│   9.4.1) Except in situations where on-screen text is lost due to missing   │
│          footage. Loss of on-screen text is considered a technical flaw.    │
│   9.4.2) Except in situations where minor missing or repeated video footage │
│          flaws are present throughout the majority of the release.          │
│          Excessive flaws such as these are considered a technical flaw.     │
│           e.g. Video frame glitches occurring every 2 minutes throughout    │
│                the entire release but only in the amount of 1 second per    │
│                instance, is considered excessive and a technical flaw.      │
│                Repeated footage occurring every 5 minutes throughout the    │
│                entire release but only in the amount of 1.5 seconds per     │
│                instance, is considered excessive and a technical flaw.      │
│                Video frame glitches of 1 second per instance occurring 6    │
│                times throughout the entire release is NOT considered        │
│                excessive or a technical flaw.                               │
│  9.5) Audio which drifts at least 120ms at a single point or a total of at  │
│       least 120ms between multiple points throughout the entire release is  │
│       considered a technical flaw.                                          │
│        e.g. Sync drifting +120ms after 10 minutes is considered a technical │
│             flaw. Sync drifting +80ms after 5 minutes, -40ms after 15       │
│             minutes, for a total of 120ms, is considered a technical flaw.  │
│  9.6) Glitches that occur in any audio channel present (e.g. L, R, C, SL,   │
│       SR) are considered a technical flaw.                                  │
│   9.6.1) Glitches are defined as, but not limited to: missing dialogue,     │
│          repeated dialogue, inability to understand dialogue, bad channel   │
│          mix, large gaps within playback, persistent clicks/pops/muted/     │

│  10.1) Minor adjustments to video or audio tracks (e.g. duplicating or      │
│        removing frames, channel count) in order to prevent issues with      │
│        playback or sync is allowed.                                         │
│  10.2) Multi-episode releases with no clear delineation between episodes    │
│        (e.g. end credits) must not be split.                                │
│  10.3) Including previously-on footage is optional, but recommended.        │
│  10.4) Including upcoming/teaser/scenes from the next episode footage       │
│        found at the conclusion of an episode is optional, but recommended.  │
│  10.5) Credits must be included if they contain unique show content. (e.g.  │
│        bloopers, outtakes, dialogue, unique uninterrupted soundtrack, in    │
│        memory of message)                                                   │
│   10.5.1) End credits must only be considered optional if they do not       │
│           contain unique show content (e.g. regular plain credits with or   │
│           without promos), and may be removed at the discretion of the      │
│           group.                                                            │
│   10.5.2) A simulcast which does not contain unique content in the credits  │
│           cannot be propered from a primary broadcaster which contains      │
│           unique content, use EXTENDED.                                     │
│   10.5.3) If a different broadcaster or re-broadcast of a show contains     │
│           unique content not present in the original broadcast, the first   │
│           release cannot not be propered, use EXTENDED.                     │
│    10.5.3.1) In situations where a unique uninterrupted soundtrack is the   │
│              only additional unique content included in the credits, use    │
│              of EXTENDED is not allowed, use INTERNAL.                      │
│    10.5.3.2) It is recommended, but not required, to include unique content │
│              included in the credits that was omitted from the original     │
│              broadcast.                                                     │
│  10.6) Inclusion of bumper segments, 5-20 second segments containing coming │
│        up/preview/backstage footage (e.g. SNL, Cops) is optional and at the │
│        discretion of the group.                                             │
│   10.6.1) In situations where bumper segments have been omitted in the      │
│           first release, a secondary release which includes all bumper      │
│           segments is allowed and must be tagged as UNCUT.                  │

│           coming up/preview/backstage footage, are not considered as bumper │
│           segments (e.g. Talking Dead, Comic Book Men, Portlandia).         │
│  10.7) Any unrelated video (e.g. commercials, rating cards, viewer/content  │
│        warnings), regardless of duration (e.g. 1 faded/half opacity frame   │
│        or 10 seconds) must be completely removed.                           │

│  14.4) If there is a question as to the validity of a source, encoding      │

│   14.4.2) Requests may be of a specific timecode to verify the sample       │
│           provided is the same source used for the encode in question       │

│   14.4.5) If there are any questionable issues (e.g. mastering flaws) with  │
│           the source, it is recommended to include uniquely named source    │
│           sample(s) within the 'Sample' directory.                          │
│                                                                             │

│   15.1.1) WEST.FEED refers to an alternative version which airs exclusively │
│           on the west coast, such as a live episode of Undateable which has │
│           two separate performances of the same episode for each coast,     │
│           east and west.                                                    │
│    15.1.1.1) Releases must be tagged as WEST.FEED when they come from an    │
│              exclusive west coast airing, even if no east feed has been     │
│              released first.                                                │
│  15.2) Variations of any additional tags are not allowed.                   │

│  15.3) READNFO should be used sparingly. Discretion is recommended.         │
│   15.3.1) The READNFO tag must not be used with PROPER, REPACK or RERIP.    │
│           The NFO is required to contain a reason, therefore the tag is     │
│           redundant.                                                        │
│  15.4) Tags must only be used once, but the order is left to the discretion │

│   15.4.1) Except in situations where the REAL tag is required to be stacked │
│           to differentiate between multiple invalid releases.               │
│            e.g. A REAL.REAL.PROPER is required for a REAL.PROPER and        │
│                 PROPER.                                                     │
│  15.5) Tags must be grouped together, period-delimited, and must follow     │
│        the mandatory directory format, see rule 16.4.                       │
│         e.g. EXTENDED.RERIP, REMASTERED.REPACK.                             │
│                                                                             │

│  18.1) Same second releases, with a maximum acceptable variance of one      │
│        second (+/- 1 second) between timestamps reported by a majority of   │
│        pre bots, are not considered dupes and should not be nuked.          │
│   18.1.1) Timestamps must be considered as whole integers and round half    │
│           towards zero.                                                     │

│                 Release C dupes Releases A and B: 1451572203 - 1451572201   │
│                 = 2, i.e. 2 > 1.                                            │
│   18.1.3) In situations where a release is found to contain a technical     │
│           flaw, same second dupes which do not exhibit any technical flaws  │
│           must be considered the final release. Groups may release a DIRFIX │
│           to PROPER for their original release, but it is not required.     │
│            e.g. Release A and Release B are released at the same time.      │
│                 Release A is nuked as containing glitches, Release B then   │
│                 becomes the de facto release and a DIRFIX to PROPER may be  │
│                 released.                                                   │

│   18.5.1) Except in situations where the aspect ratio of the release        │
│           exceeds that of its respective Retail release.                    │
│            e.g. A 2.39:1 release will not dupe a 1.78:1 retail release      │
│                 provided there is clearly more visible on-screen footage.   │
│                 Proof demonstrating this difference is recommended, but     │
│                 not mandatory.                                              │

│          UNCENSORED, UNRATED, UNCUT, WEST.FEED, WS) of its respective       │
│          retail release, and is not censored after uncensored.              │
│           e.g. An UNCENSORED.720p.HDTV.x264 release does not dupe a         │
│                censored 720p.BluRay.x264.                                   │

│         EXTENDED, OAR, OM, REMASTERED, UNCENSORED, UNRATED, UNCUT,          │
│         WEST.FEED, WS) do not dupe their counterparts or vice versa, except │
│         for censored after uncensored and FS after WS.                      │
│  18.11) Programs which have identical footage but have different narrators  │
│         in the same language (e.g. British narrator for BBC and American    │
│         narrator for Discovery) dupe each other, use INTERNAL.              │
│  18.12) Different broadcasters which offer alternate commentary and         │

│        11 must be replaced with the tagged language.                        │
│         e.g. POLISH, rule 5.6 becomes "Non-Polish spoken titles with        │

│                    Swedish hardcoded subtitles must be tagged as            │
│                    SWEDISH.SUBBED or SWESUB.                                │
│                    Danish TV series airing in Poland with Polish dubbed     │
│                    audio and no hardcoded subtitles must be tagged as       │

│                    audio and Swedish soft-subs is not allowed, use          │

│                    as FRENCH, if no other release of the episode exists.    │

│                    Le.Clan.S01E01.FRENCH.720p.HDTV.x264, only an INTERNAL   │
│                    or SUBPACK release is allowed for soft-subs in another   │
│                    language.                                                │
│    21.2.1.4) Hard-subbed releases dupe SUBPACK when the primary audio       │
│              track is not the language tagged as, use INTERNAL.             │

│                    English audio and Turkish hard-subs dupes                │

│           same foreign language tags.                                       │
│            e.g. Game.of.Thrones.S01E01.SWEDISH.SUBBED.720p.HDTV does not    │
│                 dupe Game.of.Thrones.S01E01.POLISH.DUBBED.720p.HDTV or      │
│                 vice versa.                                                 │
│                 Game.of.Thrones.S01E01.FINNISH.SUBBED.720p.HDTV does not    │
